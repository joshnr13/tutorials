MASGIS Ipython Notebooks
=========================

These are the ipython notebooks 


Software
----------

To use these, you'll need a few pieces of software. 

You'll need:

- [iPython](http://ipython.org) - interactive, literate, visual computing in
  python
- [pyproj](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyproj) - projection handling & unit
  conversion
- [GDAL](http://gdal.org) - the core FileIO engine for much of FOSS GIS
- [Fiona](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/fiona) - super minimial fileIO using GDAL
- [Shapely](http://toblerity.org/shapely/index.html) - planar geometry in GIS
- [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org) - 
- [Descartes](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/descartes)

Most of these are just python packages. Don't be worried. The only one that
might give you trouble is GDAL, but since it's really the beating heart of the
FOSS GIS world, it's good to have.

If you're interested in working iwth python on Windows, it's a great idea to use
a scientific python distribution, like Enthought's
[Canopy](https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/) or
ContinuumAnalytics [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/). **DO
NOT PAY FOR ACCELERATIONS**. You probably don't need any of the addons
advertised until you know what they do. 

Communities
-------------

Check out [Stack Exchange:GIS](http://gis.stackexchange.com) for solutions to
common FOSS GIS problems (it also has help for that other GIS package y'all
know.) In addition, [OSGeo](http://www.osgeo.org) is a great community, and I
would recommend getting on their mailing list for open source and free
software information for GIS applications. 

In addition, the SciPy community is **amazing** for learning how to use python.
In fact, the last year's SciPy conference, 2014, had an explicitly Geospatial
content track that will probably return in the coming years. All prior talks are
viewable through the Conference Talks Schedule:

- [Scipy 2013](https://conference.scipy.org/scipy2013/conference_talks_schedule.php)
- [Scipy 2014](https://conference.scipy.org/scipy2014/schedule/)

In addition, FOSS4G, **F**ree and **O**pen **S**ource **S**oftware for **GIS**
is a huge deal, and you should check it out when and if you can. Their
presentations are also usually online:

- [FOSS4G 2014](https://2014.foss4g.org/schedule/sessions/)

Just as a heads up for people who might believe that FOSS is not useful in
industry, check out the corporate sponsors for those conferences. FOSS GIS is a
big deal, and getting knowledgeable about these packages is a great idea. 

GitHub
--------

You're here. More generally, these kinds of social coding websites allow you to
share and examine open source software online and work together with others on
coding projects. In fact, git, the Content Versioning System that powers
websites like these, is much larger than just software. I'd recommend getting
competant in it, and can point you to resources to learn it.
